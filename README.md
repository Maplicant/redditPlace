# /r/place heatmap generator
Creates a heatmap with the data from https://github.com/moustacheminer/place

Before building you should install go-heatmap. You can do that by running the following command:
```
go get github.com/dustin/go-heatmap
```

To run the program, execute this:
```
go run main.go
```
and you should see a new file `out.png` in the same directory.
